My name is Sean, and I am a talented Front-End Developer with a particular expertise in React JS. As a proud US Navy Veteran, I have had the honor of serving my country and now bring my discipline and focus to my work as a developer. Through the VET-Tech program, I had the opportunity to attend PDX Code Guild, a well acclaimed coding boot-camp. My insatiable passion for coding fuels my thirst for knowledge and drives me to create dynamic projects that exceed expectations.
