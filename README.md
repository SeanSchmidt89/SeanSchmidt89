My name is Sean Schmidt. I am a Front-End Developer specializing in React JS and Javascript. I am a US Navy Veteran. I have attended and graduated from PDX Code Guild using the VET-TECH program. I have a huge passion for coding and for once in my life I have found something I would like to make a career out of.
